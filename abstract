Brain Hamorrhage is a type of stroke, which occurs due to bursting of an artery in the brain, thus causing bleeding in the surrounding tissues.
CT (Computed Tomography) images are used to diagnose bleeding and fractures in inner parts of the body. 
CT images are preferred over MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) images due to wider availability, lower cost and sensitiveness to early stroke.
These images are first pre-processed, performed morphological operations on and then segmented using watershed algorithm.
This extracted image is given as an input to an artificial neural network for classification.
It also gives information on the haemorrhage area and the haemorrhage percentage. 
These features are given as input to the classifier i.e., RNN. Using the training phase, the superimposed images are compared to the original image,
such that the type of hemorrhage is detected and the error calculated. 
In this paper by using RNN we will find the diseaseâ€™s Epidural Hemorrhage, Intracranial Hemorrhage, Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage and Subdural Hemorrhage.
